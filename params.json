Furhtermore the\r\ngraph might be not as efficient as possible because it uses `std::map` and `std::list` containers as its\r\nunderlying data structures. Again I didn't want to create a perfectly optimized implementation but to\r\nlearn and have fun coding. If you have ideas for improvements or find bugs, feel free to notfiy me about them!\r\n\r\nThe project is licensed under the GNU GPL v2 license. Have a look into the LICENSE file for more information.\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\n\r\nTo start using the `undirect_graph` simply include the `.h` files in your project and instantiate the graph\r\nwith the corresponding template arguments:\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate <typename vertex_data_type_arg, typename vertex_id_type_arg, \r\n\t\t  typename edge_data_type_arg, typename edge_id_type_arg>\r\nclass undirected_graph;\r\n```\r\nThe `edge_id_type` has to meet certain criteria, for an easy start use the supplied `undirected_pair<T>` where `T`\r\nwould be the `vertex_id_type` of the graph.\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate <typename T>\r\nclass undirected_pair;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What does it do?\r\n\r\nFor a full list of features have in look in the documentation which will be added soon.\r\n\r\nThe graph allows to store vertex data types with unique ids which are connected by edge data objects which\r\nhave in turn unique ids. Naturally the graph is implemented using templates and therefore every data type\r\nis supported.\r\n\r\nIn most operations the graph behaves similar to the `std::map` container because (a) it is built using maps and\r\n(b) it's what you're probably used to after working with stl containers. The only difference is that most methods\r\nhave an appended `_vertex` or `_edge` to indicate on which object the method works.\r\n\r\nSome example code:\r\n```c++\r\ntypedef undirected_graph<std::string, size_t, double, undirected_pair<size_t>> graph_type;\r\ngraph_type graph;\r\n\r\ngraph.insert_vertex(1, \"Hello world!\");\r\ngraph.insert_vertex(2, \"Some more text.\");\r\ngraph.insert_vertex(3, \"Hi\");\r\n\r\ngraph.insert_edge(1, 2, 44.12);\r\ngraph.insert_edge(2, 3, 22.34);\r\n\r\nfor(auto it = graph.begin_edges(); it != graph.end_edges(); ++it) {\r\n\t\tstd::cout << \"Connection\" << it->first.a << \"to\" << it->first.b \r\n\t\t\t\t  << \"with value:\" << it->second << std::endl;\r\n}\r\n\r\ngraph.erase_vertex(2);\r\n```\r\nMore example code will be added to the repository soon.\r\n\r\n## What does this project supply?\r\n\r\nThe project consist mainly of three parts:\r\n- `undirected_graph` the main component of the graph I've been writing about this whole document.\r\n- `undirected_pair` a simple data type which behaves similar to a `std::pair` except for the fact that it is just\r\nfor one data type, pair(a,b) and pair(b,a) compare as equal and it's sortable. The sorting order\r\nis determined by the smaller and bigger elements of the pairs. It's a simple data type to use for the\r\nedge ids in the graph.\r\n- `graph_search_iterator` is an abstract class that provides an interface for graph traversal iterators.\r\nTwo subclasses are supplied: a breadth-first and a depth-first iterator.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
